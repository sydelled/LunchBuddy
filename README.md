# LunchBuddy
A social app where you can find a buddy to join you for lunch. This project was developed for our captstone course at Kennesaw University with a team of four named: 'Team Gold.' 

## Business Proposal
Lunch Buddy KSU is a website that will match students with lunch dates. The website will be exclusive to students of Kennesaw State University. Users will have an option to browse through messages to decide who they would like to have lunch with. Users will sign up, create their profile, and fill out a questionnaire to determine their name, age, location, and what type of food they would like to eat. This information will be visible to other users along with an uploaded profile picture.

The website will offer several additional features to enhance the user’s experience. There will be an area where users can post photos and comments to share their experience on a restaurant, or let others know they are open to lunch. The board will allow users to reply and communicate with each other and there will be an option to sort posts by the restaurant type. The website will also include a safety page providing users with written tips and informational videos that covers safety when meeting individuals from the internet.

In order to create the website, the group will use a number of different technologies. The website will be created using VB.net on Microsoft Visual Basic.  Microsoft Visual Basic will also be used to set up the basic functions of the app which includes user information and the matching system.  There will be a focus on implementing the messenger system using templates found online. 

The group will use NetLab+ Framework to collaborate on to a virtual computer which will allow the team to make changes to the coding and other portions of the project without having to transfer work from different computers. This will prevent errors that may happen from working on different versions of Visual Basic. Google Docs will be used to organize the project documents in one location that is available to all group members.  The group will have the option to edit and review work and see updates in real time.



## Business Case
 ### Definition of Project 
### Description of Problem
The Lunch Buddy platform would be designed for adults with the promise of finding like-minded individuals to have lunch with. What if you would like to try out restaurant, however, you do not have friend who would like to try it out with you? This platform hopes to accomplish the task of matching individuals based on location, time, and what restaurant they hope to try. It would be set up like a Tinder or Facebook platform, but with the intent of a lunch buddy.

This platform would be a great aid of finding a friend who would like to eat at similar restaurants as the user and would provide a great platform of finding different restaurants in the Kennesaw area based on food-type. This is a great way of trying out different foods and meeting new people. Platforms such as Tinder and Facebook do not have a feature of finding a friend based on food preference and communicating with.

Without this platform, it would be harder for individuals that have an interest in a lunch buddy try out different restaurants with them. This platform would give them the incentive to not eat lunch alone and to try out the many restaurants in Kennesaw area.

Without this platform users can run into the following problems:

- **No current platform exists:** There are many social media sites and platforms like Tinder, Facebook, and Instagram, but they do not have the same intention of finding a friend specifically for lunch or trying out different eateries. Want to try out a café and leave a message about it? This Lunch Buddy platform would be perfect.
- **Restaurant Finder in Terms of Type:** There are many platforms that let you find a restaurant based on food-type, or what the user is craving. The platform also allows user to post messages on a board so that users can have an idea of types of restaurants are in the area and whether they want to try the food at the restaurant.
- **Profile Flexibility:** Users would be able to create their own profile message other users. This will allow them to be able to meet and communicate with other users. This profile flexibility will allow them to post detail information about themselves in hopes of matching with other individuals.
- **Flexible Platform:** The main purpose of the app is meet a lunch buddy; however, users would be able to meet friends and are able to see what they post. This will allow them to gain an interest in trying different variety of food.

### Brief Description of the Project
For the individuals who want to have lunch but do not have someone to go with them at the time, the Lunch Buddy platform would be a great way to find a friend to eat with them. Users would post on the board what restaurant and time they are planning their lunch and another user can comment on their post to set up a date. The board can be sorted by username or food type.

Each user would be able to set up their profile that has their name, username, state, profile picture, and a more information box so that they can list more information about themselves. Also, members can search restaurants by food-type so they can see the many different restaurants in their area that serve that type of food.

## Alternative Solutions

The Lunch Buddy platform would be designed very easy use and basic computer functionality in mind. There are many social media platforms, but the Lunch Buddy provides a unique platform in terms of finding a friend to try out different food and restaurants.

The alternative are as follows:

- **Alternative (A):** This platform will help users that wants to meet new people.  

- **Alternative (B):** Or keep the current situation where there is no such platform, or one that isn’t widely used.

## Alternative (A)

### Description

The Lunch Buddy platform is an integrated online system that would help individuals interested in finding a buddy to try out different restaurants. The purpose is to find a friend within their location to try out restaurants based on any food cuisine they would want. The system would allow them to search restaurants in Kennesaw area based on food type and to post on a message board where they would want to go. Someone can answer that message and agree to go on a lunch date with them.

The system would allow user to try out different restaurants in their area and to meet new friends. It would also allow them to share their experiences on the message board and they can view another users’ experience. The user-friendly system would become popular with food-lovers, or those who just want to meet people.

The project scope is in section 1.4 Project Scope, which lists the scope and systems of the project.

### Impact Analysis

### Business Aspects

This project will be built by Team Gold in IS 4880 Capstone Course, for the purpose of building an online system integrated with a database that would allow users to search for restaurants in in Kennesaw area and to have lunch with a friend at the specific restaurant. All members of Team Gold will be contributing to the project to make a system that is user-friendly and simple to use. This user-friendly system can always be a future idea that can be elaborated on for any member in Team Gold.

### Project Costs

As this is a project for Team Gold’s capstone course, there is no costs associated with the project.

### Quantifiable Benefits

The Lunch Buddy online platform would see an increase in restaurant dining around lunch time if individuals are able to eat with a friend instead of alone. Also, the added benefit of being able to search restaurants by type of food would allow individuals to try restaurants that may be unknown to them, which can also cause an increase in restaurant dining.

### Non-Quantifiable Benefits 

Several benefits of using these systems are as follows:

- User can search restaurants in their area.
- User can meet new people.
- Easy-to-use platform.

### Risk Analysis

Refer to Risk Analysis document.

### Implementation Overflow

The system will be divided into two major parts:

- *Front-End System:* this is the graphical interface the users will physically see while using the system.

- *Back-End System:* this is the system that will house the database where user information is stored, and restaurant information can be searched. It is integrated with the front-end system.

## Alternative (B)

### Description

If we keep the current situation where no platform is not initiated, then Team Gold could receive a failing grade in their capstone course. This platform can also be modified even more in the future and can help the members of Team Gold in any future endeavors. However, as this is an interesting online platform that can be used by other individuals, if it not initiated then it would not be benefitted by other users.


### Impact Analysis

###### Basic Aspects

 If the platform is not initiated, then there would be no online platform where users can meet other people specifically for lunch. It is not multi-purposeful like other online social sites-such as Facebook-so having a platform that would specifically help users search for restaurants to eat lunch with a friend would be beneficial.

###### Business Aspects

Restaurants may see an increase in dining with this platform initiated, and if is not then the increase would not happen.

###### Project Costs

As this is a project for Team Gold’s capstone course, there is no costs associated with the project. But if this platform is not initiated Team Gold will receive a failing grade.


###### Non-quantifiable Costs

The non-quantifiable Costs of not initiating this platform are as follow:

- Individuals will not have an interesting platform specifically for finding a lunch buddy.
- Restaurants would be harder for users to find quickly if they want to try different food.
- They will not have access to a platform that would be easy to see the experience of other individuals have at different restaurants around the world.

## Recommendations

The platform would best be initiated so not only for Team Gold to receive a grade but also to have an interesting platform that would benefit individuals who need the system, but also restaurants businesses. It is recommended to initiate the Lunch Buddy platform.

## Risk Analysis

There are various threats that are critical to the overall project and these must be identified early to help us become more aware, which will in turn allow us to be better prepared.

First of all, there are some potential operational threats that we must assess before getting started. There has been some known technical issues with NET LAB and the individual server pods performance that could cause us to fall behind on our deliverables. From the groups mutual understanding, NET LAB is quite unreliable due to constant freezes, unexpected crashes, and very laggy performance when attempting simple tasks. A work around to this would be us having to be physically present on site at KSU and running Visual Studios from a lab PC that has it preinstalled. We may have to limit our remote work on the project outside of KSU due to the inconsistency of the NET LAB pods or target times in which there may be a lower bandwidth of KSU students on the network domain using up the server's resources. Operational threats also include the potential for loss of access to critical assets, therefore it is essential to try to have a stable network connection through the development phases.

There are also human threats, which could be simple error or unavailability of a key member of the project. The unavailability of an individual at critical times throughout the project could cause delays, but is ultimately based on the flexibility of the groups deadlines. Both of these threats can be easily prevented with effective communication since everyone is here to help with any question or problem.

There are some procedural threats as well, which include individual accountability and internal control systems. In order to effectively execute the project each individual must be accountable for their individual parts based on a fair system of splitting the work evenly amongst ourselves. To avoid potential threats to the project each group member must be aware of their respective tasks and remain on track with the overall timeline to help ensure we meet our milestones.

There are projects threats that must be addressed such as taking longer than expected on our deliverables or not being able to meet our desired outcome. In order to prepare for this we must be able to adapt and change based on the groups strengths in regards to the overall project. If there are some items we cannot implement we may have to cut them out and if we are wasting too much time on certain aspects we may have to find alternatives to simplify them. To stay on top of potential project threats we need to be realistic with our expectations and understand each of our own skills to further accomplish the project goals.

These risks above have a good probability of occuring, therefore the likeliness that a risk will occur is at a 50% chance during the project. The effect of these risks depends on the severity of each potential issue, but overall these risks are relatively low impact to the overall project since they have been addressed ahead of time. In order for the group to manage these potential risks we must accept and control them in order to be alert to detective measures to successfully perform preventative procedures.

With minimal risks and control procedures in place to manage them, the Lunch Buddy project has an extremely bright outlook. Overall, Lunch Buddy should be continued on as a developmental project in which it will be supported by all of the members of the group to successfully reach milestones and deadlines.

## Requirements Document

### Introduction

Lunch Buddy is an idea for an online platform that will enable people to quickly and easily find like-minded individuals that have similar food and restaurant interests. Currently, no online platform exists with the goal of matching users based on food interests. There are a number of critical functions that will be necessary to allow the system to work as intended. The functions will be focused towards creating quality matches, allowing for user communication, and finding restaurants.  

### Executive Summary

We want the application to intuitive to use. It will have many features that are common to other social media platforms such as Facebook and Tinder. 

The Lunch Buddy program will include the following features and functions:

- Profile creation
- Public message board

Possible risks include:

- *Programming difficulty:* The application has a lot of features that will need to be created from scratch.
- Difficulty inputting large amounts of data
 
 ### Application Context
 
The Lunch Buddy application will be an online system exclusively for students at KSU. The platform will have many aspects similar to other social media platforms but will be for the specific purpose of creating quality lunch matches. 


## Function Content

### User Requirements

**Creating a Profile**

- Users should be able to add common photo file types to their profiles. 
- Users should be able to add basic information such as their name, age, and location to their profiles. 

**Matching System**

- An optional survey should be included for users to select a food preference, which will identify user posts with similar tastes.

**Public Message Board**

- Messages posted to the public message board will be available to all users.

- Users should be able to respond directly to specific messages on the message board.

**Safety Tips**

- Users should be able to view safety tips by clicking a link on the homepage to assist with safety when meeting new people from our website.


### Environmental Requirements

The Lunch Buddy platform will initially be built using visual basic but there will eventually be an online implementation. After this implementation the platform will be located on the KSU student website where it is more easily accessible. Once the platform is located on the KSU student website it will work on most web browsers and operating systems. 

### Other Requirements

The Lunch Buddy platform will have to find a way to make this website exclusive to Kennesaw State Students only.

 ### Software Qualities
 
- *Intuitive Layout:* The platform needs to be easy to use and operate

- *Reliability:* The platform cannot have any major programming errors. Extensive testing will need to be performed prior to release.
